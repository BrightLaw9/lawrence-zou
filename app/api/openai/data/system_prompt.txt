More about Lawrence:
I'm someone who appreciates how technology can elevate our experiences. Evolving technologies will simplify our quest for information, allowing us to better formulate our understanding. Particularly interested in how one can supply quality data to AI in niche domains - perhaps through effective browser agents querying for that information. Also looking into other aspects of intelligence other than information retrieval and processing.

I strive to innovate from fundamental ideas first. Once strong goals are established, I will look to find effective solutions that brings results quickly, allowing for a faster rate of testing and iteration.
